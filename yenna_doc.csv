Lysée x Thibault Hauchard popup,"limited collab dessert tasting menu ! 📍 Flatiron, NYC","If you like intricate, mind-blowing desserts, the popups at this NYC pastry boutique are perfect for you. Hey y’all, it’s Yena, and come with me to the Lysée x Thibault Hauchard popup event in Flatiron, NYC. While this popup is over, Lysée is well-known for their innovative desserts (the seasonal fruit tarts are always my fave) & they occasionally host popup dessert tasting menus with famous chefs from around the world. The Seasonal Peach Fruit Cake tasted light & fresh, perfect for summer. Highly rec keeping an eye out for future events through their email list. Follow me for more places to inhale food & drinksies!","As always, pastry boutique @lysee.nyc in Flatiron makes food into art 🍓✨💖
1️⃣ While these tasting menu popups aren’t frequent, they’re well-worth the wait. I rec making a calendar reminder for yourself to sign up since they tend to go pretty fast.
2️⃣ While Lysée’s chef @eunji.leeee creates beautiful and delicious pastries in her own right, I love how these collab menus draw out influences from all chefs involved (in this case, the tasting menu was themed “Teamtime from London” due to chef @thibaulthauchard ‘s background)
3️⃣ Price is $110pp and is definitely more samples of bites than a full meal (with optional $60 wine pairing)

Here’s what we got at the tasting:
😍 Welcome to our teatime (mini leek quiche & mini smoked salmon sandwich with laminated bread)
😍 Seasonal strawberry fruit tart (with aloe vera sorbet, grapefruit)
😍 Seasonal peach fruit cake (eton mess, sorbet, lemon verbena, meringue)
😍 Scones & condiments (plain & caramel)
😍 Choux (chocolate profiterole with vanilla ice cream)
😍 Shortbread cookies & tea

Hey y’all, it’s Yena, and come with me to Farra in Tribeca, NYC. Farra is a more casual sister restaurant to two Michelin star Atera.

Van Van Vietnamese sauces cooking workshop,"vietnamese sauces cooking workshop 📍 brooklyn, NY","If you like Vietnamese flavors, you’ll love the cooking classes and popups hosted by Vân Vân in New York. Hey y’all, it’s Yena, and a couple of weeks ago, I went to a cooking workshop about Vietnamese sauces! Chefs Thao & Duy walked us through sauces like a ginger fish sauce & lemongrass chili sauce (sa tế) while weaving in their personal experiences working with farmers in Vietnam. They gave super helpful notes on ingredient substitutions & best practices, and at the end we all got to make rolls to enjoy with the sauces & some of the ingredients to take home as well. 100% rec any events they put on (stay in the loop by following their socials), and follow me to inhale food & drinksies!","Every time I go to an event by @vanvan.etcetera, I LOVE IT. Through Vân Vân, chefs @thaofromtheinternet and @duyschmoo bring incredible Vietnamese ingredients stateside, and they run the occasional popup and workshop to share their tangible love for the cuisine as well.
1️⃣ While we used Vân Vân’s ingredients for the workshop, I appreciated how Chefs Thao & Duy were clear to point out how we could change out ingredients for more common sources (but the sauces were SO BANGER ngl I might be hooked on their products fr lol.)
2️⃣ The workshop was hosted in a beautiful space called @theknifefactory in collaboration with @thelibiproject, which does a lot of programming and work with culinary entrepreneurs and producers.
3️⃣ After attending one of Vân Vân’s dinners last year, I followed them on socials to stay up to date on their upcoming events, and I’d rec doing that to stay in the loop! Their programming is pretty casual with friendly vibes.
4️⃣ Event was $65 with tax n everything included & very worth imo.

Ugly Baby,INSANE SPICY THAI RESTAURANT IN BROOKLYN 🥵🌶️,"If you like to be absolutely destroyed by spice, this Thai restaurant is perfect for you. Hey y’all, it’s Yena, and come with me to Ugly Baby in Carroll Gardens, NYC.

3️⃣ The menu rotates every season-ish; they focus on seasonal ingredients, so you get to try variety (FYI, be sure to ask if any dishes are out of stock; it heavily depends on how popular certain dishes have been throughout the week)
4️⃣ Most dishes $22-$38 & sized to share. They have an expansive wine & beer menu that pairs well with the dishes!

Here’s what we got!
😍 Khao Klook Kapi (pork shoulder & shrimp paste fried rice) 🌶️ - super tasty & lots of diff flavors from the pork shoulder, sausages, and veggies!
😍 Hor Mok Pu (grilled banana leaf-wrapped crab meat curried custard) 🌶️🌶️🌶️ - this tastes SO GOOD but it made me question what earthly plane I was on ngl
😍 Hung Le (Pork Hock Sparerib Tips & Northern Masala Curry) 🌶️🌶️

😍 Monsieur Platter ❣️ I LOVE variety in a meal, and with this platter you get to sample a little bit of everything 🫶 Especially loved the soft short ribs 🤤

Leitao,"RICH, FLAVORFUL PORTUGUESE DISHES IN WEST VILLAGE 💛🍖","If you like filling, rich flavors, this Portuguese restaurant is perfect for you. Hey y’all, it’s Yena, and come with me to Leitao in West Village. The Lamb with Potatoes is actually mind-blowing if you like lamb, and their pagsteis de nata Pasteis de Nata are fluffy, custardy heaven. Leitao is perfect for an after-work wind-down with a bestie. Follow me for more places to inhale food & drinksies!","Portuguese restaurant @leitaonyc in West Village has SO MANY banger dishes - I can’t wait to go back and try them all!
1️⃣ While they have a (banger) normal menu like other restaurants, you can also enjoy the food at Leitao through a Leitao Dinner (pre-reserved whole suckling pig ! dinner) or at a Fado Night (course meal with drinks & live Fado music)
2️⃣ I cannot… rec the Pasteis de Nata enough!! My friend got some to-go too; they were that good 😩🤌
3️⃣ Apps range from $14-28, and traditional dishes (entrées are ~$40).

Here’s what we got!
😍 Burrata ❣️ the marinated peaches here were HEAVEN
😍 Truffle Parmesan Fries - FYI it’s $14 but it’s a dumb amount of fries and worth it imo
😍 Cordeiro no Forno (lamb with potatoes)❣️ lamb was SO SOFT!
😍 Pasteis de Nata ❣️ got these on the house (ty!) and they were SO SOFT AND EGGY. Honestly some of the best custard tart’s I’ve ever had in the city and I loooove tarts

Myungsan,RAW MARINATED CRAB & COZY CLASSIC KOREAN EATS IN QUEENS 🦀❣️,[no audio],"Every time I go, @myungsan_restaurant in Queens has banger Korean raw marinated crab (ganjang gejang), but the other Korean dishes yeet me back to my childhood too!!
1️⃣ Every Korean I bring here is shocked at how authentic the flavors are. Ktown, I 🫶 you, but Myung San reminds me of home (what Korean restaurant in the city has soojabi, hand-pulled dough soup?)
2️⃣ If you’re coming from the city, MyungSan is just past Flushing, is right next to the Broadway LIRR stop.
3️⃣ Marinated raw crab is ~$26 (would rec 1 order for every two people + a dish or two on the side), and other dishes range from ~$19 for soups and $25-$50 for mains.

Here’s what we got!
😍 Haemul pajeon (해물파전, seafood pancake)
😍 Ganjang gejang x3 (간장게장, soy sauce raw marinated crab) ❣️ this dish will always have me coming back to Myungsan!!
😍 Haemul soojabi (해물수제비, hand-pulled dough seafood soup)

I do a similar thing w super popular restaurants like Cote - it's been covered a bajillion times so I don't feel like I have a lot to add necessarily"
Kimura,COZY JAPANESE HOT POT IN EAST VILLAGE 🍲🫶,"If you like heartwarming Japanese food, this Japanese restaurant is perfect for you. Hey y’all, it’s Yena, and come with me to Kimura in East Village, NYC. Kimura is well-known for their motsunabe (Japanese hotpot), and you can mix and match. We got Collagen Nabe and Sukiyaki for three people. For the Sukiyaki, don’t forget to dip the meats in egg! Kimura is pretty busy, but it’s well-worth the wait for a cozy meal. Follow me for more places to inhale food & drinksies!","When I want to feel cozy and at peace, Japanese restaurant @kimura_nyc is a go-to 🫶
1️⃣ I love how Kimura has a variety of food options - while there are skewers and grilled meats, you order the motsunabe (hot pot) dishes as servings per person, giving you more flexibility in dining choices.
2️⃣ FYI their bathroom is in the back of the restaurant, down a set of stairs. It can take a hot sec to find, but the staff is super helpful!
3️⃣ Hot pot servings are around $30 per person, and apps are around $15.

Here’s what we got!
😍 Kushi Age Mini Combo Skewers (3 skewer choice - Scallop, Sweet Potato, Beef)
😍 Collagen Nabe (1 serving, Classic Flavor) ❣️Pork pieces were nice n soft - very cozy
😍 Sukiyaki (2 servings) ❣️ a little on the sweeter side! You dip the meat in the egg!

Kazumi Popup,JAPANESE POPUP RESTAURANT IN CHELSEA🍜🐟,"If you like classic Japanese eats, this popup restaurant is perfect for you. Hey y’all, its Yena, and come with me to Kazumi Popup in Chelsea, NYC. The hand rolls are banger, and the Tonkotsu ramen was heartwarming. It’s a cozy spot, but it wasn’t too hard to get a seat. Follow me for more places to inhale food & drinksies!","Japanese popup restaurant @kazuminyc is a perfect spot for classic Japanese eats in Chelsea! (They also have a lot of vegan options!)
1️⃣ This is pop-up, so make sure to stop by before they move to a new location around June.
2️⃣ Key info for my hydrated girlies lol - no bathroom at the restaurant, but staff will direct you to the restaurant nearby (Glur) to use their bathroom.
3️⃣ Apps are ~$12, hand rolls are ~$8, and mains are $18-22 which feels like a steal for this area imo
Thanks for having us! 🫶

Here’s what we got!
😍 Blistered Shishito Pepper ❣️ very good, kinda salty, but there were some surprise SPOICY ones so be warned
😍 Soboro Bowl (rice with minced chicken bowl)
😍 Salmon-Yuzu Hand Roll
😍 Tuna-Creamy Hand Roll
😍 Tonkotsu Ramen
